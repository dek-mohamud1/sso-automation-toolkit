# SSO Automation Toolkit

A local, web-based toolkit for parsing SAML metadata and generating ready-to-use
SSO configuration for **Auth0** and **customer identity providers**.

This tool is designed to eliminate repetitive manual SSO setup steps by
automatically extracting endpoints, certificates, and identifiers from SAML
metadata and presenting them in a copy-paste-ready format.

> Built as a real-world internal tooling project and adapted for portfolio use.
